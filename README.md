This is my Tableau Portfolio



Big10 Basketball Dashboard: [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nicholas.neuschwander/viz/BIG10Dashboard/BIG10TeamDash]

Descrition: This Dashboard provides analytical insight to the 2023-2024 season of Big10 Basketball. The filters are adjustable by team(s) and season(s). Data is able to be filtered by any (or multiple) of the past 10 seasons and any (or multiple) of the Big10 teams, including the new, former Pac12 additions.



PSA Grading Dashboard: [https://github.com/users/nickneusch/projects/2?pane=issue&itemId=79621303]

Description: This Dashboard provides valuable insight into the client's grades of sports cards. I imported various datasets from PSA, cleaned and transformed them using Python, and created an interactive visualization using Tableau. The purpose of the visualization is to provide my clients with information on which types of their cards are grading the best, which allows them to optimize their future orders.
